# Personal website for Chris Trivedi

This Website is based on and uses George Cushen's [Wowchemy Academic-pages theme](https://wowchemy.com/hugo-themes/), and is hosted through Netlify.

I feel I should also give credit to a few other websites that really inspired the design. Namely:

[Luke Holman](https://www.lukeholman.org/), [Leslie Myint](https://lmyint.github.io/), and [Anirban Basu](https://www.anirbanbasu.com/).
