# Personal website for Chris Trivedi

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/9dcb2c80-45d0-49ab-9dc2-142f49f39540/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/christrivedi/deploys)

This Website is based on and uses George Cushen's [Wowchemy Academic-pages theme](https://wowchemy.com/hugo-themes/), and is hosted through Netlify.

I feel I should also give credit to a few other websites that really inspired the design. Namely:

[Luke Holman](https://www.lukeholman.org/), [Leslie Myint](https://lmyint.github.io/), and [Anirban Basu](https://www.anirbanbasu.com/).
